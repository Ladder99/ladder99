Usage: ./backup SETUP

Backup the currently running Postgres database container.

This writes a pg_dump backup with -Fc (custom/compact format)
to a file in a Docker volume, then moves it out to the current directory.

# pg_dump backs up a database
#   --if-exists: adds IF EXISTS clauses to drop commands (needs --clean though)
#   -Fc: specifies the custom/compact format, as opposed to plaintext sql (-Fp)
#   --clean or -c would be ignored here since using -Fc, so do in restore cmd
#   -f: specifies the output file
