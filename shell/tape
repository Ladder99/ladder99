# specify play/record as parameter, eg

# build docker image for tape
docker build --tag tape services/tape

# run the docker image as a container
# -it is for interactive terminal
# --init passes ctrl-c to node
# --rm removes the container when it's done
# --volume links a host folder to a folder inside the container.
# tape will write to the container folder,
# and it'll be visible in the host folder.
# $* passes remaining params to the tape node app.
