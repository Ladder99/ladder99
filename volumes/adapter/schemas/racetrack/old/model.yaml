# racetrack model
# this defines the structure of the xml that will get included in devices.xml.
# text substitution is performed, eg ${deviceId} is replaced by
# that value from devices.yaml.
# dataItems are defined in outputs.yaml.
# compilation is done with sh/adapter/compile.

model:
  id: ${deviceId} # eg 'racetrack1'
  name: ${deviceId} # must be unique in xml - might want to override in devices.yaml tho?
  uuid: ${uuid} # eg 'e05363af'
  sampleInterval: 10
