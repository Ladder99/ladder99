Ladder99 Community Edition is a free and open source software pipeline that transfers data from factory devices to a database and end-user visualizations using MTConnect, an open standard.

MTConnect standardizes factory device data flow and vocabulary - it was started by UC Berkeley, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Sun Microsystems in 2008, and continues under active development.

Ladder99 is developed by MRIIOT, your agile digital transformation partners.
