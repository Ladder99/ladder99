## Ladder99

Ladder99 is a free and open-source software pipeline that transforms data from your devices to a standard vocabulary, which you can then use with any MTConnect-compatible application.

<!-- It uses the MTConnect Adapter, Agent, and Application scheme. -->

- Use MTConnect Adapter, Agent, Application scheme -->

MTConnect standardizes factory device data flow and vocabulary - it was started by UC Berkeley, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Sun Microsystems in 2008, and continues under active development.
