# outputs

# these outputs are placed in the module.xml tree and define the
# shdr strings that are calculated from the cache and sent to the agent.

# the item's key (eg 'avail') together with the deviceId (eg 'pr1')
# form its id in the xml (eg 'pr1/avail').
# the shdr key is the same as the id.
# the shdr value is defined with the item value code.

# value is javascript, evaluated by the cache in calculating the shdr output.
# <foo> is a cache lookup, shorthand for cache.get('${deviceId}/foo').value

  - key: operator_name
    value: <operator_name>

  - key: control_power_condition
    value: "<control_power_fault> ? 'FAULT' : <control_power_warning> ? 'WARNING' : 'NORMAL'"
