# inputs

# define inputs to cache
# see outputs.yaml for cache outputs to mtconnect agent.

# the ladder99 adapter subscribes to topics from an mqtt broker,
# the mqtt broker sends data from the device(s) to adapter,
# and adapter parses messages, writes values to cache, which outputs shdr
# to the mtconnect agent when the values change.

# this file is parsed by the adapter driver services/adapter/src/drivers/mqtt-json.js.

# note: cache keys are ARBITRARY,
# ie not necessarily the same as dataitem id OR name.
# eg the 'status_step' key references the cache value at 'kl1-status_step',
# which is set below, while the output key in outputs.yaml is 'step',
# which becomes eg 'kl1-step' for the SHDR id.

# the idea is to keep the SHDR id's as short as possible, to reduce network bandwidth,
# while the dataitem name can be more descriptive.
