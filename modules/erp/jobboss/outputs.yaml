# outputs

# these outputs are placed in the model.yaml tree and define the
# shdr strings that are calculated from the cache and sent to the agent.

# the item's key (eg 'avail') together with the deviceId (eg 'pa1')
# form its id in the xml (eg 'pa1-avail').
# the shdr key is the same as the id.
# the shdr value is defined with the item value code.

# value is javascript, evaluated by the cache in calculating the shdr output.
# <foo> is a cache lookup, shorthand for cache.get(`${deviceId}-foo`)

# note: cache keys are ARBITRARY,
# ie not necessarily the same as dataitem id OR name.
# eg <status_step> references the cache value at 'kl1-status_step',
# which was set in inputs.yaml, while the output key here is 'step',
# which becomes eg 'kl1-step' for the SHDR id.
# the idea is to keep the SHDR id's as short as possible, to reduce network bandwidth,
# while the dataitem name can be more descriptive.

# note: category is used to determine shdr representation.
# only need to specify category if CONDITION.
# only need to specify type if is MESSAGE.
# see end of services/adapter/src/cache.js for details.

# note: can just specify the key - value will be inferred to be <key>.
