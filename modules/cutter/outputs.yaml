# outputs

# these outputs are placed in the module.xml tree and define the
# shdr strings that are calculated from the cache and sent to the agent.

# this file is processed by adapter/index.js

# the item's id in the xml and the shdr key is `${deviceId}-${key}`
# the shdr value is defined with the item value code.

# value is javascript, evaluated by the cache in calculating the shdr output.
# <foo> is a cache lookup, shorthand for cache.get('${deviceId}-foo')

# note: cache keys are ARBITRARY,
# ie not necessarily the same as dataitem id OR name.
# eg <status_step> references the cache value at 'kl1-status_step',
# which was set in inputs.yaml, while the output key here is 'step',
# which becomes eg 'kl1-step' for the SHDR id.

# the idea is to keep the SHDR id's as short as possible, to reduce network bandwidth,
# while the dataitem name can be more descriptive.

# note: category is used to determine shdr representation.
# only need to specify category if CONDITION.
# only need to specify type if is MESSAGE.
# see end of services/adapter/src/cache.js for details.

# note: as a shortcut, can just specify the key -
# value will be inferred to be <key>.
