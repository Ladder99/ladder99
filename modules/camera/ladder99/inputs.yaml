# inputs
# this file is parsed by the adapter plugin http-json.js.

# in general, cache-key on left, json-key on right

# Adapter test plugin polls data from devices,
# parses messages, writes values to cache, which outputs shdr.

# define message handlers
handlers:
  # make $ the message payload dictionary
  initialize: '$ = payload'
  # define lookup function, which returns a value given a part calculation.
  lookup: '($, part) => eval(part)'
  # define key-part pairs, where key is mapped to a cache id,
  # eg 'connection' => 'pa1-connection',
  # and part is some javascript calculation code to determine its value.
  expressions:
    connection: $.connection
