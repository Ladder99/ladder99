Ladder99
--------------

Ladder99 is a free and open source application that transfers data from factory machines to end-user applications and visualizations using MTConnect, an open standard.

Ladder99 transforms data from your devices to a standard vocabulary, which you can plug into any MTConnect-compatible application. 


MTConnect
---------------

MTConnect standardizes factory device data flow and vocabulary - it was started by UC Berkeley, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Sun Microsystems in 2008, and continues under active development.

.. Ladder99 is a free and open Linux distribution for threat hunting, enterprise security monitoring, and log management. It includes :ref:`hive`, :ref:`playbook`, :ref:`fleet`, :ref:`osquery`, :ref:`cyberchef`, :ref:`elasticsearch`, :ref:`logstash`, :ref:`kibana`, :ref:`suricata`, :ref:`zeek`, :ref:`wazuh`, and many other security tools. Security Onion has been downloaded over 2 million times and is being used by security teams around the world to monitor and defend their enterprises. Our easy-to-use Setup wizard allows you to build an army of distributed sensors for your enterprise in minutes!

.. .. note::

..    Security Onion started in 2008 and was originally based on the Ubuntu Linux distribution. Throughout the years, the Security Onion version tracked the version of Ubuntu it was based on. For example, the last major version of Security Onion was based on Ubuntu 16.04 and so it was called Security Onion 16.04. Security Onion is now container based and thus no longer limited to just Ubuntu. To signify this change, Security Onion now has its own versioning scheme and this new platform is Security Onion 2.

.. Here are some high level system differences between Security Onion 2 and the older legacy versions:

..     - Move from Ubuntu packages to containers
..     - Support both CentOS 7 and Ubuntu 18.04
..     - Change pcap collection tool from netsniff-ng to Google Stenographer
..     - Upgrade to Elastic Stack 7.x and support the Elastic Common Schema (ECS)
..     - Remove unsigned kernel module PF_RING and completely replace with AF_PACKET
..     - Suricata completely replaces Snort (we may elect to add Snort 3.0 at some point in the future)
..     - Sguil, Squert, and capME are removed
..     - Storage Nodes are now known as Search Nodes
..     - Incorporate new tech: :ref:`hive`, :ref:`strelka`, :ref:`grafana`, :ref:`fleet`, :ref:`playbook`, :ref:`hunt`, :ref:`soc`
