## Building Agent image

The Agent image should only need to be built to handle another architecture, or keep up-to-date with the latest cppagent version -

See https://github.com/Ladder99/mtconnect-agent.

## Building documentation

This documentation is hosted by readthedocs.org, and is built and deployed automatically on changes being pushed to the GitHub repo.

To develop and view the documentation locally, first install the Python dependencies, including Sphinx, the documentation generator -

Then serve the documents, viewable at localhost:8080 -

    shell/docs
