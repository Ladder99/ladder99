Getting Started
*******************

Let's run the MTConnect Agent, which comes with a simulator for a CNC device.

On your edge device, in the ladder99 folder -

   .. code:: console

      shell/agent/test

Now you should be able to view the MTConnect Agent output on your browser at e.g. http://raspberrypi.local:5000.
