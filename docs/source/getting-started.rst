Getting Started
*******************

Let's run the MTConnect Agent, which comes with a simulator for a CNC device.

   note: this may give an error if the docker image is still set to private, in which case ``docker login``

   .. code:: console

      cd ~/ladder99
      shell/agent/test

   .. note::

      You can see all the shell commands available with

      .. code:: console

         tree shell
