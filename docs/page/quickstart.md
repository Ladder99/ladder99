# Quickstart

For tech-savy users who want to get the pipeline up and running quickly, you can install Git, Docker, Docker-compose, and run

    git clone https://github.com/Ladder99/ladder99
    cd ladder99
    ./l99 start example

This will take several minutes to build the pipeline.

Then you can visit a dashboard at http://localhost/d/main - username/password admin/grafana. It should show stats for a remote Mazak machine and the host machine.
