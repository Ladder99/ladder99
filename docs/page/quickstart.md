# Quickstart

For tech-savy users who want to get the pipeline up and running quickly, install git, docker, docker-compose, and run

    git clone https://github.com/Ladder99/ladder99
    cd ladder99
    ./l99 start example

This will take several minutes to build the pipeline.

Then visit the dashboard at http://localhost/d/main - username/password is admin/grafana.
