# Quickstart

For tech-savy users who want to get the pipeline up and running quickly, you can install Git, Docker, Docker-compose, and in a Terminal or Git Bash window, run

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Ladder99/ladder99
cd ladder99
shell/install/l99
l99 start
```

Then you can visit a dashboard at http://localhost/d/main - username 'admin', password 'grafana'. It should show stats for a remote Mazak machine and the host machine.
