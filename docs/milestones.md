# Milestones

The current plan with versions and branches is as follows:

* 0.6 main - public version
* 0.7 develop - as used by clients, work in progress
* 0.8 relay - refactor relay and db structures so can point at multiple agents
* 0.9 profiling - profile the nodejs and db, optimize where needed
* 1.0 publish - done with phase 1

We're currently (June 2022) working on 0.8 relay. 

Beyond 1.0, we'll work on a compiler for device modules and a visual builder.
