# Docker Engine starts automatically on DEB-based distributions. 
#. On RPM-based distributions, you need to start it manually using 
# the appropriate systemctl or service command.
# On Debian and Ubuntu, the Docker service is configured to start on 
# boot by default. To automatically start Docker and Containerd on boot 
# for other distros, use the commands below:
# sudo systemctl enable docker.service
# sudo systemctl enable containerd.service

# # login to docker hub
# docker login --username ladder99
