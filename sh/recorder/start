# first param is folder relative to current directory.
# specify play/record as parameter, eg
#     sh/recorder models/ccs-pa/recordings    # -m defaults to 'play'
#     sh/recorder recordings -m record -h host.docker.internal

# build docker image for tape
docker build --tag recorder services/recorder

# run the docker image as a container
# -it is for interactive terminal
# --init passes ctrl-c to node
# --rm removes the container when it's done
# --volume links a host folder to a folder inside the container.
# recorder will write to the container folder,
# and it'll be visible in the host folder.
# $* passes remaining params to the recorder node app.
