# inputs
# define values to be read by micro.js driver and how to write to cache

# we need this detailed structure so know what to read,
# where to write it, and what representation to use for writing to the agent.
# this yaml format is specific to the micro.js adapter driver.
# the item and subitem names are defined by https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation
inputs:
  #. how get this?
  # - name: connection

  #. not sure yet if better to use dataset or individual items.
  # indiv items might be easier for downstream apps to consume?

  - name: temperature
    item: cpuTemperature
    subitems: main, cores
    representation: dataset

  - name: memory
    item: mem
    subitems: total, free, used
    representation: dataset

  - name: cpu
    item: currentLoad
    subitems: currentLoad, currentLoadUser, currentLoadSystem
    representation: dataset

  # ---- most interesting ones avail

  # battery: hasBattery, currentCapacity, maxCapacity, capacityUnit, percent # mWh
  # cpu: manufacturer, brand, speed, cores
  # cpuTemperature: main, cores
  # currentLoad: currentLoad, currentLoadUser, currentLoadSystem
  # disksIO: rIO, wIO
  # dockerContainers: name, createdAt, state
