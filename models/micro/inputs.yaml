# inputs
# define values to be read by micro.js driver and how to write to cache

# these values are defined by https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation

#. we need this more detailed structure up top so know what to read,
# where to write it, and what representation to use
values:
  #. how get this?
  # - name: availability

  # - name: temperature
  #   item: cpuTemperature
  #   subitems: main, cores
  #   representation: dataset

  # - name: memory
  #   item: mem
  #   subitems: total, free, used
  #   representation: dataset

  # - name: cpu
  #   item: currentLoad
  #   subitems: currentLoad, currentLoadUser, currentLoadSystem
  #   representation: dataset

  # ---- these are temporary

  # battery: hasBattery, currentCapacity, maxCapacity, capacityUnit, percent # mWh
  # cpu: manufacturer, brand, speed, cores
  cpuTemperature: main, cores
  currentLoad: currentLoad, currentLoadUser, currentLoadSystem
  # disksIO: rIO, wIO
  # dockerContainers: name, createdAt, state
  # fsSize: fs, type, size, available
  mem: total, free, used
  # osInfo: platform, distro, release, codename, arch, hostname
  # wifiInterfaces: id, model, vendor
