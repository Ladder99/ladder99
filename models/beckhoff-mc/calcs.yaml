# these items are placed in the model.yaml tree and define the
# shdr strings that are calculated and sent to the agent.

# the item's key (eg 'connection') together with the deviceId (eg 'ccs-pa-001')
# will become its id in the xml (eg 'ccs-pa-001-connection').
# the shdr key is the same as the id.
# the shdr value is defined with the item value code.

# the value calculations are gathered together into a calcs.js file,
# which is imported to the adapter plugin.
# or this file is iterated over and items are added to the cache calcs.

# for values, <foo> is shorthand for cache.get('${deviceId}-foo').value
