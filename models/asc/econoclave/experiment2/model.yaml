# this defines the structure of the xml that will get included in devices.xml.
# text substitution is performed, eg ${deviceId} is replaced by
# that value from the device yaml.
# adapter cache items are defined in cache.yaml.
# compilation to devices.xml is done with sh/compile.

# shdr key on left, xml desc on right
# eg event(user,operator) translates to <DataItem category="EVENT" type="USER" subType="OPERATOR" />
