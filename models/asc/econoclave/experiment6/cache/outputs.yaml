# cache outputs

# these outputs define the shdr strings that are calculated from the cache
# and sent to the agent.

# this file is parsed by the adapter driver pipeline/adapter/src/drivers/cpc.js.

# left side is shdr key (will have $deviceNum appended).
# right side is javascript, evaluated by the cache in calculating the shdr output.
# <foo> is a cache lookup, short for cache.get('${deviceId}-foo').value
