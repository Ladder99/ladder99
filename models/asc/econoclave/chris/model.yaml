# this defines the structure of the xml that will get included in devices.xml.
# text substitution is performed, eg ${deviceId} is replaced by
# that value from the device yaml.
# dataItems are defined in outputs.yaml.
# compilation to devices.xml is done with sh/adapter/compile.

model:
  id: ${deviceId} # eg 'ac1'
  name: ${deviceId} # must be unique in xml - might want to override in setup.yaml tho?
