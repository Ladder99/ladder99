# asc econoclave model

# this defines the structure of the xml that will get included in devices.xml.
# text substitution is performed, eg ${deviceId} is replaced by
# that value from the device yaml.
# dataItems are defined in data.yaml.
# compilation to devices.xml is done with sh/compile.

# each dataitem can have the following values:
#   id - a short unique identifier - will be prefixed with deviceId. typically shdr key.
#   name - a longer unique identifier - will be prefixed with deviceId
#   category, type, subType, units, etc. - mtconnect values

model:
  id: ${deviceId} # eg 'ac1'
  name: ${deviceId} # must be unique in xml - might want to override in setup.yaml tho?
  uuid: ${uuid} # eg 'e05363af'
  sampleInterval: 10
