# setup for cpc autoclaves

#. will compile this with sh/adapter/compile
#. will compile to agent.cfg, devices.xml, pipeline-overrides.yaml, topology.dot?
#. include in sh/pipeline steps? ie always compile this file (or if changed)

devices:
  - id: ac1
    name: autoclave1 # this must match name in agent.cfg and devices.xml
    model: asc/econoclave
    #. do we really want/need ability to have >1 source per device?
    # won't it lead to conflicts with dataitem ids, eg connection/device-availability?
    #. just have single source and destination for now?
    sources:
      - model: asc/econoclave
        driver: cpc # type of adapter plugin - manages protocol and payload
        protocol: tcp
        host: 10.20.30.101
        # host: localhost
        port: 9999

    #. this should be server(s), not destinations - for agent to connect to
    destinations: # where to post output - just handles one output for now
      - protocol: shdr
        host: adapter
