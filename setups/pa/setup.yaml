# this defines the devices.xml structure, along with the model yamls.
# read by services/adapter/src/adapter.js.
# sources define the inputs to the cache.
# compiled by services/compiler into devices.xml.
#. see also devices-future.yaml for future dev.

#. maybe call this setup.yaml?
# have setup: {meta:, devices:}, etc

#. could we get this to one line per device? a site might have dozens of machines
# eg set defaults at the top, overrides per device?
