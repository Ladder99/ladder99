# VMC (default) setup

This setup handles the default VMC (vertical machining center) 3-axis CNC simulation included with the MTConnect Agent.

No volumes/agent folder or setup.yaml are needed here, as the Agent includes the agent.cfg and devices.xml file for this setup. See the current versions online here -

- agent.cfg - https://github.com/mtconnect/cppagent/blob/master/simulator/agent.cfg
- devices.xml - https://github.com/mtconnect/cppagent/blob/master/simulator/VMC-3Axis.xml

or local copies in the reference folder here.
