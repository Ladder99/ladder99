# VMC setup

This setup handles the VMC (vertical machining center) 3-axis CNC simulation included with the MTConnect Agent.

No volumes/agent folder or config/devices.yaml are needed here, as the Agent includes the agent.cfg and devices.xml file for this setup - see the reference folder for copies.
