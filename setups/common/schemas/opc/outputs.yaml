# define outputs from cache to agent

# this file is processed by ladder99/services/adapter/src/index.js etc.

# these outputs are placed in the agent.xml tree and define the
# shdr strings that are calculated from the cache and sent to the agent.

# the item's id in the xml and the shdr key is `${deviceId}-${key}`, eg 'opc-user1'.
# the shdr value is defined with the item value code.
# value is javascript, evaluated by the cache in calculating the shdr output.
# <foo> is a cache lookup, shorthand for cache.get('${deviceId}-foo')

# note: cache keys are ARBITRARY,
# ie not necessarily the same as dataitem id OR name.
# the idea is to keep the SHDR id's as short as possible, to reduce network bandwidth,
# while the dataitem name can be more descriptive.

# note: category is used to determine shdr representation.
# only need to specify category if CONDITION.
# only need to specify type if is MESSAGE.
# see end of ladder99/services/adapter/src/cache.js for details.

# note: as a shortcut, can just specify the key -
# value will be inferred to be <key>.

#. most outputs could be pass-through, and wouldn't need to be specified here
# eg key=avail, value: <avail>. then could get away without an outputs.yaml file.

outputs:
  - key: avail
  - key: user1
  - key: user2

  - key: cond
    category: CONDITION # value should be NORMAL, WARNING, or FAULT
    value: "<user1>==='HELLO' && <user2> > 10 ? 'FAULT' : 'NORMAL'"
