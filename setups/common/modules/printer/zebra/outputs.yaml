# outputs

# these outputs are placed in the module.xml tree and define the
# shdr strings that are calculated from the cache and sent to the agent.

# see services/adapter/src/drivers/printer/zebra.js for cache inputs.

# the item's id in the xml and the shdr key is `${deviceId}-${key}`
# the shdr value is defined with the item value code.

# value is javascript, evaluated by the cache in calculating the shdr output.
# <foo> is a cache lookup, shorthand for cache.get('${deviceId}-foo')

# category is used to determine shdr representation.
# default category is EVENT or SAMPLE - specify for others.
# specify type if is MESSAGE.
# see end of services/adapter/src/cache.js for details.
