# outputs

# these outputs are placed in the model.yaml tree and define the
# shdr strings that are calculated from the cache and sent to the agent.

# the item's key (eg 'avail') together with the deviceId (eg 'pa1')
# form its id in the xml (eg 'pa1-avail').
# the shdr key is the same as the id.
# the shdr value is defined with the item value code.

# value is javascript, evaluated by the cache in calculating the shdr output.
# <foo> is a cache lookup, shorthand for cache.get('${deviceId}-foo')

outputs:
  - key: avail
    value: <availability>

  - key: job # processes/job/process_aggregate_id-order_number
    value: <job>

  #. how handle writing to other devices?
  # could specify device here and use that in getOutputs fn
  # but how know the device types in advance?
  - key: start # processes/shift/process_time-start
    device: c
    value: <start>

  - key: complete # processes/shift/process_time-complete
    device: c
    value: <complete>
