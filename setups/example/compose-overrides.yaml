# docker-compose overrides
# overrides and extends the values in ladder99/services/compose.yaml

# see other client repos for ideas for adding information to services.
# typically, would add 'profiles: - base' to each service used.
# that way, we know what is needed, and can start them all with
#   ./l99 start <setup>
# which runs the 'base' profile by default.

# version must be a string - need 3.8 for profiles
version: '3.8'
