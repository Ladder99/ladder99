[paths]

# Path to where Grafana stores the sqlite3 database (if used), file-based
# sessions (if used), and other data. This path is usually specified via
# command line in the init.d script or the systemd service file.
#. shouldn't this be /var/lib/grafana instead?

# Grafana needs a database to store users and dashboards (and other things).
# By default it is configured to use sqlite3 which is an embedded database
# (included in the main Grafana binary).
# [database]
# Either mysql, postgres or sqlite3, it’s your choice.
# type = sqlite3


[dashboards]

# Path to the default home dashboard. If this value is empty, then Grafana
# uses StaticRootPath + "dashboards/home.json".
# make sure this matches a file in etc/dashboards

[panels]
# need this so can use javascript in text panels,
# in order to translate a variable (line=1 or 2) to a url (the different plcs)
# for the label images.
# it's a potential security risk, if someone can change the panel source
# to write malicious javascript.
# so avoid if possible.
