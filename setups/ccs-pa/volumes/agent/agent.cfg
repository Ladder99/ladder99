# Devices - The XML file to load that specifies the devices and

# found the defaults are tried.
# Defaults: probe.xml or Devices.xml
# note: need full path here.

# BufferSize - The 2^n number of slots available in the circular 
# buffer for samples, events, and conditions.
# Default: 17 -> 2^17 = 131,072 slots
# BufferSize = 17

# MaxAssets - The maximum number of assets the agent can hold in its 
# buffer. The number is the actual count, not an exponent.
# Default: 1024

# CheckpointFrequency - The frequency checkpoints are created in 
# the stream. This is used for current with the at argument. This 
# is an advanced configuration item and should not be changed unless 
# you understand the internal workings of the agent.
# Default: 1000
