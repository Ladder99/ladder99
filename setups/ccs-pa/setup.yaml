# ccs-pa setup

# define the devices.xml structure, using the model yamls for dataitems.
# read by pipeline/adapter/src/adapter.js.
# sources define the inputs to the cache.
# compiled by pipeline/src/adapter/compiler into volumes/agent/devices.xml
# and volumes/agent/agent.cfg.
#. see also devices-future.yaml for future dev.

#. add a meta section

#. could we get this to one line per device? a site might have dozens of machines
# eg set defaults for all devices at the top, overrides per device?

devices:
  - id: pa1 # this is substituted into the model yaml and sources

    model: ccs/print-apply # for xml structure - see models/ccs/print-apply/model.yaml
    #. shift these up, look for each explicitly
    properties: # these are substituted into the model yaml
