# Yetter setup

Yetter has some Mazak CNC machines (with built-in MTConnect Agents?).

Set the agent endpoints in pipeline-overrides.yaml, comma-delimited.

This setup includes a Grafana prototype dashboard - will replace with a Superset dashboard.

Agent is not needed, as we just use Relay to dump data from the endpoints to the Database.
