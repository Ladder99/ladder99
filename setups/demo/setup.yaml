# demo setup with camera simulations

#. compile this with sh/adapter/compile
#. will compile to agent.cfg, devices.xml, pipeline-overrides.yaml, topology.dot?
#. include in sh/pipeline steps? ie always compile this file (or if changed)

#. any way to get to one device per line? see below...

#. idea for templates - define macros/fns/templates, then instantiate them

# templates:
#   - camera(id,name,sourcePort,destPort):
#       id: $id
#       name: $name
#       model: ladder99/camera

#           host: play
#           port: $sourcePort
#       destinations:
#         - protocol: shdr
#           host: adapter
