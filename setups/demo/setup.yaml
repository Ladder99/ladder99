# demo setup with camera simulations

#. compile this with sh/adapter/compile
#. will compile to agent.cfg, devices.xml, pipeline-overrides.yaml, topology.dot?
#. include in sh/pipeline steps? ie always compile this file (or if changed)

#. any way to get to one device per line?
# ie define default settings then have overrides per device?
