# Setups

A setup defines the devices in a network, their module definitions, and configuration settings for the pipeline services.

The directories here are examples used to develop the different modules.

The pipeline service defaults are set in `services/compose.yaml` - each setup should have a setup.yaml file and any pipeline setting overrides in compose-overrides.yaml.
