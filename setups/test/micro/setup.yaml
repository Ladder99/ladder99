# setup for microcontroller

# compile this with sh/compile
#. will compile to agent.cfg, agent.xml, pipeline-overrides.yaml, topology.dot?
#. include that in sh/pipeline steps? ie always compile this file (or if changed)

devices:
  - id: m1
    name: micro1 # this must match name in agent.cfg and agent.xml
    structure: micro

    # specify sources for dataitem values
    #. eg could have multiple thermometers for a machine, or doors
    #. be careful with multiple sources - don't want to clobber dataitems
    sources:
      - model: micro #/ladder99/glimpse
        driver: micro # adapter plugin - manages protocol and payload

    # where to post output - just uses first output for now
    destinations:
      - protocol: shdr
        host: adapter
        port: 7878
