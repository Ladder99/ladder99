# define the devices.xml structure, using a model.xml for dataitems.

# sources define the inputs to the cache.
# compiled by ladder99 compiler into volumes/agent/devices.xml
# and volumes/agent/agent.cfg.

#. could we get this to one line per device? a site might have dozens of machines
# eg set defaults for all devices at the top, overrides per device?
